                <h2>Office Management System</h2>
                <h5>This project involved directing the development of a comprehensive system to streamline office operations and manage daily activities.</h5>
                <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, C# .NET MVC, Microsoft SQL Server</p>
                <ul><h5>
                    <li>Order Recording and Processing: <br>
                        <p>
                        Officers receive these requests and record them within the system, categorizing them with different levels or 
                        statuses to indicate their progress. The system then analyzes the student's requirements and matches them with 
                        suitable teachers based on criteria such as expertise, availability, location, etc.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Teacher Matching and Selection:<br><p>
                        Once the system identifies potential matches, it presents this information to students, allowing them to choose 
                        their desired teachers from the available options. Students may have access to teacher profiles, which could 
                        include information about their qualifications, teaching experience, ratings/reviews from previous students, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Order Status Tracking: <br><p>
                        The system tracks the progress of each order, indicating whether it's in the pending stage (awaiting teacher 
                        selection or confirmation) or the complete stage (after the hiring process is finalized).Officers can view the 
                        status of each order, monitor who is assigned to it, and track its progress through different stages.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Task Management and Monitoring: <br><p>
                        Officers have access to a dashboard or interface where they can view their daily tasks and assignments. Tasks 
                        are categorized based on priority, deadline, or status, allowing officers to efficiently manage their workload. The 
                        system provides real-time updates on task statuses, ensuring officers stay informed about pending tasks and 
                        completed activities.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Financial Indicators: <br><p>
                        The system may include financial tracking features, allowing officers to monitor budget allocations, expenses, 
                        payments to teachers, etc. Officers can generate reports or summaries to analyze financial data, identify trends, 
                        and make informed decisions about resource allocation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>  Role-Based Access Control: <br><p>
                        Access to different features and functionalities within the system is restricted based on the roles and positions 
                        of users (officers, teachers, administrators, etc.).This ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to 
                        authorized personnel and helps maintain data security and confidentiality.</p>
                    </li>
                </h5>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h5>The Tutoring Website project introduced a powerful search feature, enabling teachers to easily 
                    find students based on their location and enhancing communication.
